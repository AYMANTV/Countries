# Countries
Free IPTV with legally receivable TV channels for Kodi, VLC or other media players as .m3u for Kodi. :-) The idea and the launch of the repo started at the end of 2019. From the beginning, it was written on the flag to provide ONLY LEGAL streams for everyone. You don't need a VPN, everything in the m3u's should be available everywhere.

# Soon there will be another change!

Whether there will be this change now depends on the further behaviour of some people:

Just as Mr Huisman demands something to change, I make the following demand!

1. Mr Huisman IMMEDIATELY ENDS HIS HUNTING CAMPAIGN
2. Mr Huisman publicly apologises to Free-IPTV because many of his claims have NOT been true for some time
3. Likewise, the sheeps, lemmings and other hangers-on end the hate campaign against Free-IPTV

If we find a way and I accept it, the following happens:

1. The private repo is deleted
2. All m3u's we have with the newest and latest streams will go back into the public repo!
3. Anything posted by Free-IPTV regarding the smear campaign here or in other media will be deleted by us!
4. Free-IPTV also publicly apologises

There will be new and simple rules, whoever simply copies and pastes our work as before and does not mention Free-IPTV as a source will be put on the 01_Blacklist.md and will also be mentioned on Twitter and the WP-Blog of Free-IPTV. 

What comes now, let's wait and see what the reaction is. I hope that sanity and reason will prevail. A hate campaign should rather be made against the ILLEGAL PROVIDERS but not against Free-IPTV.

**We now have over 5000 free and legal streams, no rights are violated, there are no violations of existing laws. This should be supported and not boycotted with stupid actions.**
