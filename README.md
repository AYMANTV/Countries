# Countries
Free IPTV with legally receivable TV channels for Kodi, VLC or other media players as .m3u for Kodi. :-) The idea and the launch of the repo started at the end of 2019. From the beginning, it was written on the flag to provide ONLY LEGAL streams for everyone. You don't need a VPN, everything in the m3u's should be available everywhere.

# Soon there will be another change!

Whether there will be this change now depends on the further behaviour of some people:

Just as Mr Huisman demands something to change, I make the following demand!

1. Mr Huisman IMMEDIATELY ENDS HIS HUNTING CAMPAIGN
2. Mr Huisman publicly apologises to Free-IPTV because many of his claims have NOT been true for some time
3. Likewise, the sheeps, lemmings and other hangers-on end the hate campaign against Free-IPTV

If we find a way and I accept it, the following happens:

4. The private repo is deleted
5. All m3u's we have with the newest and latest streams will go back into the public repo!
6. Anything posted by Free-IPTV regarding the smear campaign here or in other media will be deleted by us!
7. Free-IPTV also publicly apologises

There will be new and simple rules, whoever simply copies and pastes our work as before and does not mention Free-IPTV as a source will be put on the 01_Blacklist.md and will also be mentioned on Twitter and the WP-Blog of Free-IPTV. 

What comes now, let's wait and see what the reaction is. I hope that sanity and reason will prevail. A hate campaign should rather be made against the ILLEGAL PROVIDERS but not against Free-IPTV.

**We now have over 5000 free and legal streams, no rights are violated, there are no violations of existing laws. This should be supported and not boycotted with stupid actions.**

Friday, 16 July 2021: There are always a few people who think they can continue to spread lies about Free-ITV. I offer a peaceful way and just wait for those who remain factual and think. In Germany there is a saying that goes "Der Klügere gibt nach". ;-)

Saturday, 17 July 2021: Thanks to Mr. Matt Huisman, point 1 is almost fulfilled. :-) Unfortunately, there are also guys who are apparently too stupid to use their brains. Point 3 is NOT fulfilled! More info here:

So the end is unfortunately open, thank the guy (link) who seems to have no brains ;-)

Saturday, 17 July 2021: Late afternoon! Because of the agitation and the lies of the 2 idiots Geonsey and Apsattv, exactly what they are afraid of is now happening! That is the ONLY reason why they keep on agitating, hoping that IPTV will give up. That's what we say... fuck you both, it's NOW going full REpo online for ALL.

... and more and more. Hate, lies... Fear that FREE-IPTV will go back online completely because WE have the best repo with legal streams, over 5100 streams!!!!

Saturday, 17 July 2021: 23:06 (MHZ +1) - the private repo has just been deleted! Fuck you Geonsey and and Free2ViewTV, That's the only reason for your agitation, because we are better, not only in the search results... Haha...

# How to use the m3u´s

The lists work fine with me in the IPTV Simple Client from Kodi or the VLC Player. To automatically create the individual lists
to one list, I use the Add-on IPTV-Merge from Matt Huisman. ;-) You find this great Add-on here: [IPTV Merge Kodi Add-on](https://www.matthuisman.nz/2019/02/iptv-merge-kodi-add-on.html)

Without Kodi you can use the lists in the VLC Media Player. :-)

You can also use the `ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u`, there you have all TV stations in one list (.m3u).

The remote path to the m3u´s is (Example):

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Free-IPTV/Countries/master/DE01_GERMANY.m3u

or the playlist (all streams in one file):

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Free-IPTV/Countries/master/ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u

# Important to contributors (fork)

If you add streams to your current fork and make a pull request, please note the following:

1. Pay attention to the alphabetical order (0-9. A-Z).
2. Add the same Group-Name, it is the Country
3. Do not add any GEO-Blocked streams, the streams in my M3Us can be seen by anyone, anywhere.
4. Don't add illegal streams. Unfortunately there have been people who already did that and gave the name Kodi a bad reputation through their ignorance.
5. Don't add new parameters. Only use these tags and order: #EXTINF:-1 tvg-name="" tvg-id="" tvg-logo="" group-title=""` and no others!

I'm always grateful for any help, it's a lot of work. If everything fits, your pull request will also be accepted. :-)

Have a nice weekend!
