And for idiot MH! I don´t copy, i find the streams self with an Samsung TV of a friend and with tools to find subdomains!!!! In your m3u's are ONLY the crappy URL's from amazonaws.com in it, which have constantly dropouts! I have the streams from wurl and amagi, they run clean! Why is:

-TOP FILM DE
-KINO DE
-DEUTSCHES KINO DE
-ROMANCE DE 

and some others not in your lists??? Why are they NOT in your lists, you are supposed to be so good! They have been in our m3´s for a longer time! Haha...

2 Examples, Subdomains and the correct stream address (DK and DE):

Subdomain;rakuten-gratis-topfilm-1-eu.rakuten.wurl.tv
Correct stream: https://rakuten-gratis-topfilm-1-eu.rakuten.wurl.tv/playlist.m3u8
Subdomain: travelxp-travelxp-2-de.samsung.wurl.com
Correct stream: https://travelxp-travelxp-2-de.samsung.wurl.com/manifest/playlist.m3u8

and so on. It is similar with Amagi.TV! So... fuck you and don't talk that bullshit about copy your stocking streams from amazonaws.com!

Just stop posting lies about our repo, in the long run you are ONLY hurting yourself! And... Never going to give you up... Haha... 

Have a good week

11-July 2021: Important changes in all files, it is not an update of the streams!

Some well-known island monkeys think they are so clever. Now the laughter is on my side again. The IPTV-Merge add-on from the idiot MH now works again with all m3u's. A warm greeting to the idiot MH Haha.... "Never going to give you up"... to change your code and harm the users of FREE-IPTV.... Haha...
